x Eating grass gives the rabbit the amount of energy GRASS_ENERGY

x If a rabbit is surrounded by rabbits it doesn't move

x Grass can grow under rabbits

"Implement sliders for the following variables of the simulation:"
=> Sliders? Not input fields ? The default number input fields will do just fine (according to an assistant. Precise it in the report)

x A rabbit loses XXX amount of energy per move

x The energy lost by reproducing is XXX

x We assume the grid to be a square

The field is empty at step 0. 

x The simulation will stop if : xxxx

x We cannot set the number of rabbits as higher than the total amount of available tiles

x We cannot set the growth rate of the grass as higher than the total amount of available tiles
